I don't know why, but I love saying "Cinnabunn Bunny" for some reason...

Anyways! Let's talk about how this model came about. At first, she was one of my ideas for MMD-Mall's "Model of the Month" entries since the theme was "zodiac". She was supposed to be from the Chinese Zodiac, the Rabbit, but then I scrapped the idea to make a "Leo the Lion" model instead.

After finally finishing my Leo, I thought "why not make the rabbit as well?", so here she is. A pastel timid little rabbit girl. I would have made this another entry for MotME, but I'm pretty sure that it's too late for that. Oh well, that's fine.

She's not really an OC... More like, just a human design of the rabbit, but I will still call her Cinnabunn. I don't really get the "Chinese Zodiac" vibe from this design though...

Q: Hmm... Why is this rabbit wearing glasses...?

A: That's because she didn't eat enough carrots as a little bunny!
